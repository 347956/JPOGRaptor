# JPOGRaptor 🦖

This mod adds the Raptor from the game [Jurassic Park Operation Genesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_Park:_Operation_Genesis).

> ⚠️  
> The Raptor is still WIP
> It should function good enough to work as an outside enemy in the game, but still needs further tweaking and updates.

## Description 📃
JPOGRaptor is a fully animated custom enemy that can spawn outside during the night time.
The Raptor will chase you and try to kill you with a pounce or its bites. It is able to call for back-up of other Raptors so be careful!

### Behaviour ▶️
- Player spotting:
	- The Raptor still uses the default spotting of players infront of it in x range.
    - I plan to tweak this further
- Chasing:
    - The Raptor is able to call for back-up from other raptors when it spots a player.
	- The Raptor will chase the player.
- Attacking:
	- The Raptor will attempt a pounce attack once close enough.
    - Collide with the raptor and it will damage you.
- Killable:
	- The Raptor should take 2 shot gun hits to kill.
    - The Raptor should take around 5-6 shovel hits to kill.
    - The Raptor does damage to other monsters when colliding.
