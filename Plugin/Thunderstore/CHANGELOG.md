## 1.0.1
Small fix.
- Fixed the wrong assetbundle being packaged.
    - This should make the raptor be able to load in game
    - This could also update some of its behaviour as the wrong/old assets were bundled.

## 1.0.0
This is the first release of the JPOGRaptor.
It is still WIP but should function good enough as an enemny ingame.
- Initial release
- Enjoy!
