## 1.0.2
A lot of minor fixes
- Added more layers to the navMesh of the Raptor
    - It should now be able to reach more places.
- The Raptor should now no longer attempt to reach/chase players inside the ship if it is not in the ship itself
- The Raptor should now check if it has a clear path before attempting to pounce on the player
    - improved pounce animation
- The Raptor should now correctly begin chasing the player who hit it (during a chase)
- The Raptor should no longer play the hit sound effect once its dead and gets hit

## 1.0.1
Small fix.
- Fixed the wrong assetbundle being packaged.
    - This should make the Raptor be able to load in game
    - This could also update some of its behaviour as the wrong/old assets were bundled.

## 1.0.0
This is the first release of the JPOGRaptor.
It is still WIP but should function good enough as an enemny ingame.
- Initial release
- Enjoy!
